# T_Rex-Game-Auto-Controller
Its a basic image processing model using machine learning. It takes the images of screen as an input the and send it to the model to do a assinged function when it detects any black pixel between our assinged contour area.

In the T_rex game we will get a hurdle one after another coming towards our T-rex dino but our dino is stable at a position so we used this and we detected an area through contour whenever hurdles comes in that area then it will send our system to automatically click the key as per assinged in the code.

In this we used pyautogui.
For installing pyautogui libraries : !pip install pyautogui
